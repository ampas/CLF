CLF Implementation
==================

Usage
-----
Common LUT Format files contain a single ProcessList with an arbitrary
number of ProcessNodes.

The full specification for the format is available here
https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/tree/master/documents

Python
******
More extensive examples are included in tests/UnitTestsCLF.py

import clf

# Create a ProcessList
pl = clf.ProcessList()

# Set a name
pl.setName('Example transform')

# Add a Matrix ProcessNode
mpn1 = clf.Matrix(clf.bitDepths["FLOAT16"], clf.bitDepths["FLOAT16"], "someId", "Transform2")
mpn1.setMatrix([3, 4, 3], [0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0])
pl.addProcess(mpn1)

# Write the CLF to disk
pl.writeFile("/some/path/test.clf")

# Process a color with the ProcessList
processValue = [0.5, 0, 1.0]
processedValue = pl.process(processedValue, verbose=True)
