Academy / ASC Common LUT Format (CLF)
=====================================


Context
---
This bundle contains an implementation of the Academy / ASC Common LUT Format (CLF). The format was developed as part of the Academy's ACES project.


Goals
-----

The Python implementation of CLF:

- Includes reading, writing and querying data structures
	- And processing data where appropriate
- Is meant to be open, accessible, easily understood
- Is NOT meant to be fast
	- A C/C++ implementation is needed

CLF
---
### Library
aces/clf/

- Provides simple Python interface to read, write and query CLFs, and process colors with CLFs
- Implements the S-2014-006 specification included in the ACES 1.0 release
- Implements the Autodesk CTF extensions
	- [Documentation](http://docs.autodesk.com/flamepremium2015/index.html?url=files/GUID-460BA05D-3AB7-4BE2-AD30-01F9D3440CD8.htm,topicNumber=d30e147706)
	- Some extensions have proprietary behavior which is not open.
		- Ex. The Reference ProcessNode
- Implements the Duiker Research extensions
- Does little checking for validity of the ProcessList data
- Includes unit tests demonstrating
	- Creating a ProcessList and various ProcessNodes
	- Reading a CLF
	- Writing a CLF
	- Processing colors with a CLF

### Tools
clfinfo

- Prints information about a CLF to the terminal

filterImageWithCLF

- Reads an image, applies a CLF to the image, writes a new image

convertLUTtoCLF

- Converts from the different LUT formats to CLF
- LUT formats currently supported are: spi1d, spi3d and csp

convertCLFtoLUT

- Converts from CLF to different LUT formats
- LUT formats currently supported are: spi1d, spi3d, csp, clf

convertOCIOtoCLF

- Converts from a set of OCIO colorspace definitions to CLF
- Accepts source color spaces and destination color spaces.
- Currently supported OCIO transforms: Group, File, Log and Matrix
	- Missing transforms: Allocation, CDL, Exponent
		- ColorSpace, Display and Look transforms not supported either. These are references to other transforms so should be simple to support eventually.
	- Not all flags are supported.
		- Ex. 'inverse' for Matrix Transforms

Extensions
---------------------
- Autodesk extensions
	- Gamma ProcessNode
	- Log ProcessNode
	- Reference ProcessNode
		- With some separation of Autodesk-specific functionality like the 'alias' attribute
	- ExposureContrast ProcessNode
	- 'bypass' Attribute
	- DynamicParameter Element
	- ASC-CDL 'style' keywords
- Duiker Research extensions
	- Group ProcessNode
		- Useful for organizing list of nodes that represent a single filter/transform
	- 'floatEncoding' Array Attribute and associated behavior
	- gzipped reading and writing

Would be nice to have
---------------------

- An 'inverse' style for ProcessNodes such as LUT1D, Matrix, Range, ASC CDL.

The original author of this CLF implementation is:

- Haarm-Pieter Duiker

Dependencies
------------
The CLF (aces/clf) module can be used independently. The tools that work with CLF depend on the following libraries:

- [OpenImageIO](http://openimageio.org)
- [OpenColorIO](http://opencolorio.org)
